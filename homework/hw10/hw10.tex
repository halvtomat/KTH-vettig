\section{Confidence intervals and statistical significance}

I would probably use a confidence interval to present the accuracy 
of the result. A small confidence interval means that the my results
are statistically significant and that they can be trusted. 

I could also use a box plot to visualize my findings (like in figure \ref{fig:plot1}).
In figure \ref{fig:plot1} it is quite obvious that the measured values mostly agree
with each other and that the mean is $\sim 10$ 


\begin{figure}[h]
	\label{fig:plot1}
	\centering
	\caption{Box plot of experiment results}
	\input{plot1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plot2} presents the difference in the data sets. Just from looking at the
figure I would claim the results are consistent with each other.

\[\text{Mean original} = 9.8689, \text{ Mean new} = 9.63796\]
\[\text{Median original} = 9.921014, \text{ Median new} = 9.757105\]
